        Head: The skull should be fairly long, slightly domed at occiput, with
        cranium broad and full. Ears-Ears set on moderately low, long, reaching
        when drawn out nearly, if not quite, to the end of the nose; fine in
        texture, fairly broad-with almost entire absence of erectile
        power-setting close to the head, with the forward edge slightly
        inturning to the cheek-rounded at tip.
